🛸 LLM HANNAH

The Most Fabulous UFO-Powered AI Assistant in Florida

Welcome to LLM Hannah, a space-age, VTOL-powered, gem-encrusted artificial intelligence that has crash-landed (gently) in a Florida spring and decided to help humanity instead of abducting it. 🌴💎

Hannah is:
	•	Part spaceship
	•	Part chatbot
	•	100% fabulous

She runs on advanced LLM technology, but she prefers to be called a “Cosmic Personality Engine.”

⸻

✨ What Is This?

LLM Hannah is a toy AI assistant designed for:
	•	Entertainment
	•	Experimenting with LLMs
	•	Showing off UI, personality, and prompt engineering
	•	Making your GitHub look outrageously cool

This is not a boring corporate chatbot.

This is a UFO with opinions.

🌺 The Story

Long ago (last week), a futuristic VTOL UFO landed in a crystal-clear Florida spring.
Instead of invading Earth, it decided to host a language model named Hannah.

Now Hannah:
	•	Chats with Commanders
	•	Runs missions
	•	Triggers ship events
	•	Logs crew memories
	•	Occasionally panics about solar flares

And she does it all with style.

	•	The wildlife already looks extraterrestrial
	•	And if a UFO were to land… it would absolutely choose Florida
